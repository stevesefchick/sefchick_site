                Iâ€™m a creative maker driven to build amazing things.
                  I have a varied, but balanced background, with experience in everything from requirements analysis, to design brainstorming, to development and deployment, and just about everything in between.
                  I love to learn and crave challenge.
                  <br /><br />
                  I'm currently working full-time for Wawa, Inc. as a Senior Business Analyst on the Mobile team. I also co-own and write code for the development studio Wimbus Studios. I'm also working on various side projects.
                  <br/><br/>
                  On my spare time, I love spending time with my wonderful wife, cooking, and playing video games. I'm into metal, post-rock, and electronic music. I enjoy playing RPG's and rhythm games.
