          I love to help create amazing products and experiences! <br /> <br />
                
                Both in my professional career and my development hobbies, I love to make things that are both fun and interesting. I believe that my comfort zone is boring, and I'm always looking for new things to try! <br /> <br />

                I'm currently working full-time for Wawa, Inc. as a Product Owner on the Customer Data Platform Team. I'm also involved in various side projects ranging in medium and scope. I've shared my favorites on this site and hope that you'll check them out!
